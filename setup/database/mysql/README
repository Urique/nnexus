In order to enable NNexus to use a MySQL backend, you need to:

1. Set a NNexus user password at setup_nnexus_mysql.sql

2. Execute:

mysql -u root -p < setup_nnexus_mysql.sql

mysql -u nnexus -p < schema.sql

3. Add the DB credentials to the NNexus configuration file at setup/config.json

---

If these steps succeed, you should be able to have t/021_mysql.t succeed at "make test".
