Let S be a semigroup. An idempotent eS is primitive if for every other idempotent fS , ef=fe=f=0e=f

A semigroup S (without zero) is completely simple if it is simple and contains a primitive idempotent.

A semigroup S is completely 0 -simple if it is 0 -simple and contains a primitive idempotent.

Completely simple and completely 0 -simple semigroups maybe characterised by the Rees Theorem ([Ho95], Theorem 3.2.3).

Note:

A semigroup (without zero) is completely simple if and only if it is regular and weakly cancellative.

A simple semigroup (without zero) is completely simple if and only if it is completely regular.

A 0 -simple semigroup is completely 0 -simple if and only if it is group-bound.
